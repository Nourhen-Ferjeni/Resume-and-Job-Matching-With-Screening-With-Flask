# Resume and Job Matching with Screening

## Introduction
In today’s digital era, the recruitment process has been profoundly transformed by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).  
One impactful application is automated resume screening, where ML algorithms streamline candidate selection.  

This project showcases an end-to-end pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification models to:  
- Categorize resumes  
- Provide personalized job recommendations  
- Seamlessly extract key candidate information
